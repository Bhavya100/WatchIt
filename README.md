# WatchIt!
## Web Development Mini Project

### Online streaming service where you can watch TV Series, Web Series, Movies, etc.

Change the paths in the html files according to your PC.

Downloading just the frontend folder will also do as the rest are just test files. For any queries you can mail me and I will guide you through the entire process.

I had a backend of approximately 40GB which consisted of just movies and TV Series. Can't upload such big files here. Will upload them on Google Drive in the same manner in which I had on my device. Will provide the link here once it is done. The link may ask for permission. I will grant permission as soon as I get notified.

#### Do checkout my IEEE SAKEC App 
It is an app made for the student chapter IEEE of my college.
